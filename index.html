                        As a member of the Google Developer Club, I actively participate in workshops, coding sessions, and collaborative projects focused on Google technologies and tools. I contribute to organizing events, assist in teaching programming concepts, and work with fellow members on developing innovative applications. My role involves continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in the tech industry, fostering a community of enthusiastic developers.
                        <h3 class="h3">Robocon :</h3>As a member of the Robocon Club, I engage in designing, building, and programming robots for various competitions and projects. My role includes collaborating with team members on engineering solutions, testing and troubleshooting robotic systems, and participating in club events and workshops to enhance my skills in robotics and automation. This position provides hands-on experience with advanced technologies and fosters teamwork in achieving complex engineering challenges.
                        <h3 class="h3">Founder and Developer, Lost and Found UTM:</h3>
                        I established the "Lost and Found UTM" Telegram group to support the university community in efficiently managing lost and found items. This initiative aims to streamline the process of reporting and finding lost belongings within the university. Currently, I am planning to develop a software solution that will further enhance the group's functionality by automating item reports, categorizing posts, and providing a more user-friendly interface. This is an independent project, where I will leverage my skills in software development and community management to create a valuable resource for the UTM community.
                        <h3 class="h3">Robotics and Electronics Projects:</h3>I participated in a science fair in 2018 at the division level, where I achieved 3rd place for my innovative project. Since then, I have independently developed a variety of robotics and electronics projects, including an obstacle-avoiding robot, a line follower robot, an automatic spray machine designed for disinfection during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a security doorbell system. These projects have allowed me to hone my skills in programming, electronics, and problem-solving, consistently working solo to bring my ideas to life. My hands-on experience in these projects reflects my passion for technology and my ability to tackle complex challenges independently.
